OOPS CONCEPTS:
--------------------
-Class
-Object
-Polymorphism
-Data Abstraction
-Inheritance

CLASS:
---------------------
It is a blueprint of object

OBJECT:
------------------------
It is a instance of class

For Example, When we take a class of cars having different brands like objects 
and properties like colour, speed, engine, manufacturer and 
also performs functions like start, stop, move and etc.

POLYMORPHISM:
-----------------------
Ability to exhibhit the operations in more than one form with different behaviours

For Example, As a software engineer on could perform multiple tasks based
 on the requirement either it can be coding, testing, designing and analysing.

ABSTRACTION:
----------------------------
It is basically of showing essential features and hiding non-essential features to the user.

For Example, When we login through yahoo mail it shows options to compose, inbox, outbox, 
sentmails and etc but when the user perform the operations the internal operations will not be known.

ENCAPSULATION:
--------------------------
Binding the data and code into  a single unit.

For example, A car is having multiple parts..
like steering,wheels,engine...etc..which binds together to form a single object that is car. 

INHERITANCE:
-----------------------------
Deriving a new class from the existing class,is called Inheritance.
class Address
{
String name;
Srting H.no;
String Street name;
}
class LatestAddress extends Address
{
String City;
String State;
String Country;
}
public class house
{
{
LatestAddress la = new LatestAddress();
//Assign variable accordingly...
}
}

1. Object             - Instance of Class
2. Class               - Blue print of Object
3. Encapsulation    - Protecting our Data
4. Polymorphism   - Different behaviors at different instances
5. Abstraction        - Hiding our irrelevant Data
6. Inheritence        - One property of object is acquiring to another property of object
